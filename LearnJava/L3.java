//Lesson 3

public class L3 {
public static void main(String[] args){
System.out.println("Hello Me");
var x = new L3();
x.tacos();//object
}
public void tacos(){//so doesnt need static
    System.out.println("mexican tacos");//more ways to print
}
}

//works fine with no indent
//static - doesnt need instance
//class - contains everything - has members
//methods - do stuff
//statements - tell computer to do something
//every program needs a main for code to execute
//properties - store something
//accesss modifier (public or private) - Who can use
//object - instance of a class
